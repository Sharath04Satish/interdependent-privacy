ABOUT THIS RESEARCH 
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Scientists do research to answer important questions that might help change or improve the way we do things in the future. This consent document will give you information about the study to help you decide whether you want to participate. Please read this form and ask any questions you have before agreeing to be in the study.



TAKING PART IN THIS STUDY IS VOLUNTARY 

You may choose not to take part in the study or may choose to leave the study at any time. Deciding not to participate or deciding to leave the study later will not result in any penalty and will not affect your relationship with the University of Utah.



WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE? 

The purpose of this research is to understand the smartphone usage. This study is being conducted by graduate students, Manila Devaraja, KRAISORACHOTE HARRY JENS PHANICH, Sharath Satish and and Professor Sameer Patil from the University of Utah.



HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART? 

If you agree to participate, you will be one of up to 150 participants taking part in this study.



WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY? 

Participating in the study should take 12-15 minutes on average and involves the following steps:

1. You will first be asked screening questions.

2. You will continue to the study questionnaire if you qualify based on your answers to the screening questions. If you do not qualify, you will be asked to return the task on the platform.

3. You will answer questions regarding smartphone usage and provide basic demographic information. You may skip any questions you are not comfortable answering. 



WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY? 

There are no foreseeable risks involved in participating in this study other than those encountered in everyday life. There is a small risk that you may feel some discomfort in contemplating your responses. However, you are free to skip any questions you do not wish to answer.



WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY? 

This research is not intended to provide any direct benefit to you. However, you may benefit indirectly by developing an increased understanding of smartphone permissions. Your responses will help us understand people’s usage of smartphone permissions and help design more effective user interfaces for permission settings.



HOW WILL MY INFORMATION BE PROTECTED? 

We will protect your information and make every effort to keep your personal information confidential, but we cannot guarantee absolute confidentiality.  We will anonymize all responses prior to analysis such that your responses cannot be connected to you in any way. Study responses will be used only for research purposes. No information that could identify you will be shared in publications about the study. Your personal information may be shared outside the research study if required by law. We may need to share your research records with other groups for quality assurance or data analysis.  Anonymized responses (with no possibility of connecting back to specific individuals or organizations) may be openly shared to increase research transparency and facilitate future research. 


WILL I BE PAID FOR PARTICIPATION? 

Those who qualify to participate and complete the study attentively will receive extra credit in the course in which the study was distributed.


WILL IT COST ME ANYTHING TO PARTICIPATE? 

There is no cost to you to participate in this study.



WHOM SHOULD I CALL WITH QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS?
